# Cpp-Project


This repository includes a C++ project. 

This code functions as a Market vs. Player system. It accepts a file containing name of individuals with their corresponding list of stocks. This file was provided by Michigan State University and cannot be published on github. One .cpp file acts a Market system and the other .cpp file acts as a Player interacting with the market.

The Market.cpp opens the stock file, stores the stocks into a vector, gets the price os a particular stock with a corrsponding date, and retrieves the highest and lowest values of a certain stock.

The Player.cpp can purchase and sell in the Market.cpp stock by entering the stock, date, and amount. New players can also be added to the market.
